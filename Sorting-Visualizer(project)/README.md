Sorting Visualizer

An interactive web-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step.
The project visually demonstrates sorting processes such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, making it an excellent educational tool for beginners learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

Features

Real-time visualization of popular sorting algorithms

Adjustable array size and sorting speed

Interactive controls — generate a new array, choose an algorithm, and start sorting

Color-coded bars to represent comparisons and swaps

Responsive design — works smoothly on all devices

Algorithms Implemented
Algorithm	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Stable	Description
Bubble Sort	O(n²)	O(1)	Yes	Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
Selection Sort	O(n²)	O(1)	No	Selects the smallest element and places it at the beginning
Insertion Sort	O(n²)	O(1)	Yes	Builds the sorted array one item at a time
Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n)	Yes	Divides the array into halves and merges them in sorted order
Quick Sort	O(n log n)	O(log n)	No	Picks a pivot and partitions the array around it
